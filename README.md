# LexiStats
This project explores a comprehensive book dataset, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Hypothesis Testing to uncover patterns in book ratings, reviews, and characteristics. 
The goal is to derive meaningful insights about reader preferences, book success factors, and potential biases in ratings.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools:

Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

Notebook & IDE: Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Findings & Insights:

1. Do longer books receive higher ratings?
2. Are books with more reviews inherently better rated?
3. Does genre influence rating distribution significantly?

## 🚀 How to Run the Notebook:

Clone the repository:

```python
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codexia.git
```
Install dependencies:
```python
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```
Open Jupyter Notebook and explore eda_analysis.ipynb & hypothesis_testing.ipynb.
